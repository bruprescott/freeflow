Some general notes.  This is just a place for me to keep track of interesting
info on the web.

The linear motor is set up for 1000 cts/in

From RMVS challenge document:
- Must deliver at least 400ml of air in 1.5 sec
  Minimum flow rate is then 267 ml/sec

  Googling around a bit suggests that most ventilators 
  have a maximum flow rate of 60 to 120 L/min.
  That would be 1000 to 2000 ml/sec

  Max pressures are in the 40cmH2O region

  I found a calculator to calculate TV based on patient size.
  https://www.mdcalc.com/endotracheal-tube-ett-depth-tidal-volume-calculator

  It gives two values, 6mL/Kg and 8mL/Kg

  6' male: 468 - 624mL
  5' male: 300 - 400
  5' female: 276 - 368
  4' female: same as 5'


Important display, pressure on x-axis, tidal volume on y
